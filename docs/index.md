## Software Installation Guide

You will need to install the necessary software on to your laptop to bring to the class each day so you can code along with us.

*   An archived version of the installation guide we used for the 2017 edition is available [here](https://pp4rs.github.io/2017-uzh-installation-guide/).
*   The most recent version of the installation guide is [here](https://pp4rs.github.io/installation-guide/), but it may have evolved substantially since the course ran.


!!! tip
    Please try and install all the software before the course begins.
    If you are struggling we are able to help - but we expect you have tried to work through the guide yourself.
